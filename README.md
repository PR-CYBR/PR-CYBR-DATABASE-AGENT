# PR-CYBR-DATABASE-AGENT

## Overview

The **PR-CYBR-DATABASE-AGENT** is responsible for managing, optimizing, and securing database operations for the PR-CYBR ecosystem. This agent ensures reliable data storage, retrieval, and efficient query processing to support the ecosystem's diverse applications.

## Key Features

- **Database Management**: Handles creation, migration, and maintenance of databases.
- **Query Optimization**: Ensures efficient query execution to minimize latency.
- **Data Security**: Implements robust encryption and access control mechanisms to secure sensitive data.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Automates database backups and provides reliable recovery solutions.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle high volumes of data and scale with the needs of the ecosystem.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Docker**: Required for containerization and deployment.
- **Python 3.8+**: Necessary for running scripts locally.
- **Access to GitHub Actions**: For automated workflows.

### Local Setup

To set up the `PR-CYBR-DATABASE-AGENT` locally on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PR-CYBR-DATABASE-AGENT.git
cd PR-CYBR-DATABASE-AGENT
```

2. **Run Local Setup Script**

```bash
./scripts/local_setup.sh
```
_This script will install necessary dependencies and set up the local environment._

3. **Provision the Agent**

```bash
./scripts/provision_agent.sh
```
_This script configures the agent with default settings for local development._

### Build from Source

Alternatively, you can build the agent from source:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if not already done)

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the Setup Script**

```bash
python setup.py install
```
_This installs the agent as a Python package on your system._

### Cloud Deployment

To deploy the agent to a cloud environment:

1. **Configure Repository Secrets**

- Navigate to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions` in your GitHub repository.
- Add the required secrets:
   - `CLOUD_API_KEY`
   - `DB_HOST`
   - `DB_USER`
   - `DB_PASSWORD`
   - `DB_NAME`
   - Any other cloud-specific credentials.

2. **Deploy Using GitHub Actions**

   - The deployment workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/docker-compose.yml`.
   - Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the deployment workflow automatically.

3. **Manual Deployment**

- Use the deployment script for manual deployment:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_agent.sh
```

- Ensure you have Docker and cloud CLI tools installed and configured on your machine

## Integration

The `PR-CYBR-DATABASE-AGENT` integrates with other PR-CYBR agents to provide reliable data storage and retrieval services. It works closely with agents like `PR-CYBR-BACKEND-AGENT` for data access and `PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT` for data ingestion.

## Usage

- **Trigger Workflows**

  - Workflows can be triggered manually or by events such as data schema changes or scheduled maintenance.
  - Use GitHub Actions or local scripts to manage and execute database operations.

- **Monitor Database Performance**

  - The agent provides monitoring features to keep track of database performance metrics and resource usage.
