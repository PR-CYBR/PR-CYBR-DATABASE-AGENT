# OPORD-PR-CYBR-DATABASE-8

## 1. OPERATIONAL SUMMARY
The objective of this OPORD is to update the PR-CYBR-DATABASE-AGENTâ€™s files to facilitate the loading of users into an interactive terminal program. This will be accomplished by executing a setup script that employs TMUX to create multiple terminal windows for enhanced user interaction.

## 2. SITUATION
The flexibility of data access is critical for PR-CYBR's mission, necessitating a streamlined interface that empowers users to navigate seamlessly through database functionalities.

## 3. MISSION
The PR-CYBR-DATABASE-AGENT is tasked with updating the following files:
- `src/main.py`
- `scripts/setup.sh`
- `setup.py`
- `tests/test-setup.py`
- `README.md`

These updates will ensure that the script utilizes `scripts/setup.sh`, deploying TMUX to open four interactive terminal windows as specified.

## 4. EXECUTION

### 4.A. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
The mission will revolve around ensuring that the database functionalities are adequately represented and accessible through the newly structured terminal setup.

### 4.B. TASKS
1. **File Updates**
   - Update `src/main.py` to launch the setup script appropriately.
   - Revise `scripts/setup.sh` to automate the process of cloning the necessary repository and configuring the TMUX windows.
   - Adjust `setup.py` to include any new dependencies that may result from these updates.
   - Enhance `tests/test-setup.py` to validate the new terminal functionalities.
   - Update `README.md` to reflect the changes and provide guidance on using the new system.

2. **Implementation of TMUX**
   - Clone the aliases repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/cywf/aliases.git
     cd aliases
     cp bash_aliases /home/$USER/.bash_aliases
     source ~/.bashrc
     cd install-scripts && chmod +x tmux-install.sh
     ./tmux-install.sh
     tmux new -s pr-cybr
     ```
   - Set up the following terminal windows:
     - **Window 1**: Introduction screen featuring a welcome message, options menu, and a progress indication bar.
     - **Window 2**: Execute `htop` for system monitoring.
     - **Window 3**: Execute `tail -f` to monitor logs created by `scripts/setup.sh`.
     - **Window 4**: Display output of `ls -l` in the root directory of the repository.

## 5. ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS
- All changes should be documented and reflected in version control.
- Conduct a review of the terminal functionalities with key stakeholders to gather feedback and ensure alignment with goals.

## 6. COMMAND AND SIGNAL
- Regular updates should be communicated via PR-CYBR's established communication frameworks.
- Ensure all agents are aware of the new functionalities and can integrate them effectively into their workflows.

**This OPORD binds the PR-CYBR-DATABASE-AGENT to fulfill its roles effectively while furthering the goals of the PR-CYBR initiative.**
